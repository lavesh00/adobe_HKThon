## 🧠 Technical Approach – Adobe Hackathon 2025 Solution

This solution is designed in two intelligent, modular phases that align with the hackathon structure:

---

## 🔹 Round 1A – PDF to Structured JSON

### 🎯 Goal:

Convert input PDFs into structured JSON containing the document title and a hierarchical outline of section headings with levels and page numbers.

---

### 📥 1. PDF Parsing & Text Extraction

* PDFs are processed using **PyMuPDF (fitz)** to extract clean text from each page.
* The system reads layout-aware text to preserve natural paragraph and heading structure.
* Multi-page documents are parsed sequentially to extract text in logical reading order.

---

### 🏷️ 2. Title Detection

* The solution extracts the **document title** using metadata.
* If metadata is unavailable, the system uses the **visually dominant text line on page 1**, typically the title, by analyzing font sizes.

---

### 🧩 3. Heading Detection & Outline Structuring

* Each line in the text is analyzed using:

  * **Regex** to identify structured headings like `1`, `1.2`, `2.3.1`, etc.
  * **Capitalization pattern** to detect all-uppercase headings.
  * **Font size hierarchy** to identify nested headings.

* Based on the heading format, each heading is assigned a level:
  `H1` → Top-level section
  `H2`, `H3`, etc. → Subsections

* Output includes:
  `{"text": "1. Introduction", "level": "H1", "page": 1}`

---

### ⚡ 4. JSON Output Generation

* All detected headings are compiled into a **clean, hierarchical JSON structure**, including:

  * `title`
  * `headings[]`: each with text, level, and page number.

---

## 🔹 Round 1B – Multi-PDF Semantic Intelligence

### 🎯 Goal:

Given a **persona** and a **job-to-be-done**, intelligently identify and rank the most relevant sections across multiple PDFs.

---

### 🧠 1. Persona Understanding

* The persona text is processed using **spaCy NLP** to extract key concepts, noun phrases, and entities.
* These extracted terms are treated as the **semantic query** for downstream matching.

---

### 📚 2. Section Aggregation

* All input PDFs are first processed via **Round 1A**.
* The `section_splitter` module splits the PDF text into coherent sections based on heading boundaries.
* Each section is associated with a heading, page number, and body content.

---

### 📐 3. Semantic Matching & Scoring

* Each section is encoded into a vector using either:

  * **TF-IDF** vectorization, or
  * **MiniLM sentence embeddings** (via `sentence-transformers`) for deeper semantics.

* The persona is similarly vectorized.

* **Cosine similarity** is computed between the persona vector and each section vector.

* Sections are assigned a **relevance score** based on this similarity.

---

### 💬 4. Explanation Generation

* The system identifies **overlapping keywords** between the persona and section content.
* These keywords are used to create a short **natural-language explanation** for why a section is relevant.

---

### 📊 5. Section Ranking & Output

* All sections are sorted by **similarity score**.
* The final JSON includes:

  * PDF name
  * Page number
  * Section heading
  * Relevance score (rank)
  * Explanation of match

---

## 🧰 Engineering Highlights

### 🧾 Config Management

* `config.py` uses **pydantic** for managing parameters such as:

  * Score thresholds
  * Debug mode
  * Model selection

---

### ⚙️ Preloading and Speed Optimization

* A `preload_model.py` script loads the transformer model into memory for faster inference.
* All components are optimized for **CPU-only environments** with minimal dependencies.

---

### 📦 Containerization

* The entire app is **Dockerized** with:

  * `Dockerfile` for clean build
  * `docker-compose.yml` for optional orchestration
* No GPU needed. The solution works seamlessly in **cloud or local environments**.

---

### 🧪 Testing and Automation

* `scripts/test.sh` automates validation of both Round 1A and 1B.
* Benchmark scripts evaluate runtime and scalability.

## ✅ Final JSON Output Overview

### 📁 Round 1A Output:

```json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "headings": [
    {"text": "1. Introduction", "level": "H1", "page": 1},
    {"text": "1.1 Background", "level": "H2", "page": 2}
  ]
}
```

---

### 📁 Round 1B Output:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "input_documents": ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"],
    "persona": "Sustainability Officer",
    "job_to_be_done": "Find ESG Reporting Guidance",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-28T10:30:12"
  },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "pdf": "doc1.pdf",
      "heading": "2. ESG Strategy",
      "page": 3,
      "importance_rank": 1,
      "explanation": "Matches on: sustainability, ESG, governance"
    }
  ]
}
```
